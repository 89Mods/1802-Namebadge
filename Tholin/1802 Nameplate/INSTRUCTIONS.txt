## Installation instructions

	- Import the unity package
	- Put the Nameplate prefab anywhere you like. Feel free to mess with the material settings to customize (e.g. edit the text color)
	- To replace the placeholder sign text with your own, open the tool under "Tools > Tholin > 1802 Namebadge program generator"
	- Drop in the texture called "program". Its right next to the prefab and this instructions file.
	- Enter the sign text you want. Keep in mind that you are limited to just uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers and a handful of special characters. The tool will let you know if you entered something that contains invalid characters.
	- If you get no errors after pressing "Generate", it worked. Note: be aware that already running instances of the namebade in the scene don't automatically update with the new text immediately. But the avatar should have the correct sign text on its badge after upload.
